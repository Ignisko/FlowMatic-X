# FlowMatic-X
FlowMatic-X: A project to simulate autonomous vehicle behavior using CARLA and reinforcement learning techniques.
The aim is to implement vehicle perception, path planning, decision-making, and reinforcement learning techniques.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Main code for the project (vehicle control, lane detection, etc.)
- `docs/`: Documentation for the project.
- `scripts/`: Scripts for running simulations or other utilities.
- `models/`: Trained models (e.g., RL agents).

## Setup

1. Install CARLA simulator (see [CARLA Documentation](https://carla.org/)).
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install carla pygame numpy opencv-python
    ```
3. Run the basic simulation:
    ```bash
    python src/basic_simulation.py
    ```
